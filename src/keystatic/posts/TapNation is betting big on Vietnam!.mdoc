On April 25, TapNation, the publishing powerhouse behind over 1 billion global downloads, visited Hanoi to engage directly with Vietnam's game development community.

The event spotlighted the explosive potential of Hybrid-Casual, Casual, and Puzzle games—genres that are not only dominating mobile trends today but are also projected to drive significant global growth well into 2025 and beyond. These game types continue to capture a broad and engaged audience thanks to their accessible gameplay, high retention potential, and monetization versatility. In addition to sharing industry insights and expertise, TapNation reinforced its commitment to nurturing the ecosystem by actively seeking long-term collaborations with local studios and publishers. Through hands-on publishing support, creative guidance, and prospective game acquisition opportunities, TapNation aims to empower regional developers to scale globally and build sustainable success.
